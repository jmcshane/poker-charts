poker-charts
============

Creating charts using Highcharts to display results from weekly poker game.  This heavily uses Java 8 and functional programming.  I create a Java REST service using Spring 4 and then consume that service using AngularJS. AngularJS then pushes the data to Highcharts to create the interactive charts.

I still need to create the part to interact with Google drive.
